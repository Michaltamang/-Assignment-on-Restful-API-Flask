        "  > A RESTful API (short for Representational State Transfer API) is a way for computer systems to communicate over the internet using standard HTTP methods—kind of like how you and I are chatting using a shared language. It's widely used because it's simple, scalable, and works well with web technologies.\n",

        "# 4. What is routing in Flask?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "  > GET is used to retrieve data from a server. It appends parameters in the URL and does not alter the server's state. This method is considered safe and idempotent, meaning multiple identical requests yield the same result.\n",
        "\n",
        "  > POST is used to submit data to a server, typically resulting in the creation or modification of resources. It sends data in the request body and may change the server's state. Unlike GET, POST is not idempotent.\n",

        "# 9. How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?\n",
        "\n",
        "  > Error handling in Flask APIs involves defining custom responses for various error conditions to ensure clear communication between the server and the client. It enhances API reliability and user experience by returning appropriate HTTP status codes and descriptive messages when something goes wrong.\n",
